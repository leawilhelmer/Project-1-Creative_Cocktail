# Group Project - SQL Injection
In this project our team created a cocktail web application that references several different server-side and in-browser API's.


## Motivation
To create a cocktail for a dinner party or some sort of event. This app targets future bartenders or those looking to polish up their mixology skills. Our site can be an educational and entertaining resource.

	Every good bartender needs to both make a drink and entertain their guests.
	Coupling together a Joke API and a Cocktail Recipe API allows our userbase 
	to better learn and understand the ins and outs of bartending in general. 
	One must both make an excellent drink and employ showmanship to impress their 
	guest. That’s what our app does.
